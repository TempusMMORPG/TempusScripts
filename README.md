# 💯 TempusScripts - The Ultimate Skibidi NPC & Molang Rizzpack 💯  

Welcome to **TempusScripts**, the **sigma grindset** of Cobblemon NPC & Molang scripting examples. If you're trying to mog other devs with your scripting skills, this is the **W Rizzpack** for you. **FR FR, NO CAP.**

## 🔥 What is this?  
This repo contains a **giga-chad** datapack filled with Cobblemon NPC and Molang script examples that will have you outcoding the **NPCs IRL**. You wanna add **schmovin'** NPCs with the **most giga AI?** This is your chance, my friend.

## 📜 Features (Mogging Edition)  
- 🏆 **Sigma-tier Cobblemon NPC scripting** – These NPCs do more than just stand there like **Ohio Final Bosses**.  
- 🧠 **Molang examples that will rizz up your server** – Make your NPCs move smoother than a **Discord mod when they see a new kitten PFP**.
- 💀 **Zero NPC behavior left unmogged** – They **witowy** do what you tell them.  

## 📥 Installation (So easy even an NPC could do it)  
1. **Download** the datapack from the repo (Click the green “Code” button, then “Download ZIP” like a true **Sigma**) AND/OR **Fork** your own copy of the datapack.
2. **Extract** it and slap that bad boy into your `datapacks` folder in your Cobblemon world.

## 🔧 Usage 
- **Example NPC Scripts**: Copy, paste, modify – turn your NPCs from **Ohio residents** into **GigaChads**.
- **Customize Everything**: Don't like something? Change it. The code is your playground, don't be an **NPC**, take control.
